# K-Means


K-means is a widely used and most popular unsupervised clustering algorithm.
In this repo I have provided a template for the K-means algorithm in Python.

This notebook has all the steps one has to follow for any ML algorithm right from data cleaning to graphical visualization of the accurary metrics for the K-means algorithm.
